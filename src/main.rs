// ownership is a central feature of rust
// rust manages it's memory through "ownership"
// ownership is based on rules that the compiler checks at compile time

// The Stack and the Heap
/// Both are parts of memory that are available at runtime
/// The stack stores values in the order it gets them
/// The stack retrieves data in the opposite order
/// The stack's method of data storage is known as "last in, first out"
/// Adding data to the stack is called "pushing onto the stack"
/// Retrieving data from the stack is called "popping off the stack"
/// All data on the stack must have a known, fixed size
/// Data with unknown/changing size at compile time must be stored on the heap
/// When you put data on the heap you request a certain amount of space
/// The OS finds an empty spot in the heap that is big enough then:
///  Marks it as being in use
///  Returns a pointer (address to that spot)
/// The heap's method of data storage is called "allocating on the heap"
/// Pushing values onto the stack is not considered allocating because the pointer is a known, fixed size
/// You can store the pointer on the stack but if you want the data you must follow the pointer
/// Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap
/// Access data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack
/// When functions are called the args are pushed onto the stack
/// Function local variables are also pushed onto the stack
/// When the function is finished those values are popped off the stack
/// Ownership allows you to minimize the amount of duplicate data on the heap
/// Ownership allows you to clean up unused data on the heap (avoids running out of space)

// Ownership Rules
/// Each value in Rust has a variable that's called its owner
/// There can only be one owner at a time
/// When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped

// Variable Scope
/// Range within a program for which an item is valid
///

// String Type
/// str is a string literal and is a fixed sized
/// String is allocated on the heap and is able to store an amount of text that is unknown

// s is not valid here because itâ€™s not yet declared
fn main() {
  let s = "hello"; // s is valid from this point forward
  let mut s = String::from(s); // converts string literal to a mutable string type by calling for memory on the heap through the os
                               // :: is an operator that allows us to namespace this particular "from" function under the string type rather than using some sort of name like string_from
                               // This type of string can be mutated
  s.push_str(", world!"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String
  println!("{}", s); // doing stuff with s while it's valid

  let x = 5; // both x and y are pushed onto the stack because they are integer values with a simple fixed known size (5: i32)
  let y = x; // binds 5 to x and copies value of x and binds it to y

  // String is made up of three parts: a pointer to the memory that holds the content of a string, a length and a capacity
  // this group of String data is pushed to the stack but the memory that holds the actual contents is stored on the heap
  // pointer stored on the stack for the string points to the content in the heap
  // the length is how much memory (in bytes) the contents of the String is currently using
  // the capacity is the total amount of memory (in bytes) that the String has received from the OS
  let s1 = String::from("hello"); // requests allocation on the heap for a new String
  let s2 = s1; // Content is not copied only the data pointing to the same content is copied
               // Pointer, length and capacity data from s1 is copied to a new variable called s2 and stores the same data as s1 on the stack
               // if s1 and s2 try to go out of memory at the same time it will try to free the same data and will cause a double free error
               // freeing memory twice can lead to memory corruption which can potentially lead to a security vulnerability
               // to ensure memory safety Rust considers s1 no longer valid
               // this isn't a shallow copy because the first variable is no longer valid (it's called a move)
               // it is to be said that s1 was moved to s2
               // since s2 is the only valid variable with the same data it is the only String that rust frees at the end of the scope
  let s3 = s2.clone(); // if we want a deep copy (more resource expensive because it is copying contents and requesting a new spot on the stack) we can call .clone() method
  println!("{} {} {} {}", s2, s3, x, y); // s1 is the only one that wont work because it was "moved"
                                         // x works because integers with a fixed value and size (i32) are stored on the stack and deep copies are quick to make (doesn't invalidate x and both are dropped at the end of the scope)
  take_ownership(s3); // s3's value moves into the function and is no longer valid here
                      // println!("{}", s3); // this is invalid because s3 was just moved
  make_copy(x); // x's value moves into the function but i32 is Copy so it's okay to still use x afterward
                // println!("{}", x); // this is valid because i32 is Copy and isn't moved
  let s3 = take_and_give_back(s2); // s2 is moved into the function and the return value is moved into s3
  println!("{}", s3);
  let (s2, s3) = return_multiple_values(s3); // ownership of s3 is sent to the function and the function returns a tuple with multiple Strings that are stored on the new into new variables
  println!("{} {}", s2, s3); // both s2 and s3 are valid now
                             // because of this when s2 goes out of scope nothing happens (it was moved) but now s3 is dropped at the end of this scope (main owns it still)
  using_a_reference(&s2); // doesn't pass ownership to the function but rather a reference (pointer) to the String object
                          // s2 is still valid to use

  let s = String::from("hello world"); // was mutable but doesn't have to be anymore with str slices
  first_word(&s); // word will get the value 5
                  // s.clear(); // this empties the String, making it equal to ""
                  // word still has the value 5 here, but there's no more string that
                  // we could meaningfully use the value 5 with. word is now totally invalid!
                  // string slices are the solution
                  // a string slice is a reference to part of a String
  let hello = &s[0..5]; // String is slices from h character to space (first (0) is inclusive and last (5) is exclusive)
  let world = &s[6..11]; // internally the slice data structure stores the starting position and length of the slice which corresponds to the ending_index minus starting_index
                         // .. is range syntax start..end (if you leave out start or end it will start at the first index 0 to value or value to end (..2 == 0..2 && 2.. == 2..102))
  println!("{}, {}!", hello, world);
} // now s isn't dropped because it was moved but x is still dropped
  // this scope is now over and s is no longer valid and the memory for our String type is returned to the OS
  // we know the contents of string literals at compile time so the text is hard coded directly into the final executable
  // string literals are immutable
  // String type supports mutability because it is allocated on the heap
  // this means that the memory must be requested from the operating system at runtime
  // we need a way of returning this memory to the OS when we're done with the String
  // Rust automatically returns memory when a variable goes out of scope
  // Rust automatically called a function called drop at the end of a block

// if a type has the Copy trait then an older variable is still usable after assignment
// Rust won't allow type if the type has implemented the drop trait
// any group of simple scalar values can be Copy and nothing that requires allocation or is some form of a resource is Copy

// Types that are Copy:
// All the integer types, such as u32.
// The Boolean type, bool, with values true and false.
// All the floating point types, such as f64.
// The character type, char.
// Tuples, if they only contain types that are also Copy. For example, (i32, i32) is Copy, but (i32, String) is not.

fn take_ownership(a_string: String) {
  // a_string comes into scope
  println!("{}", a_string);
} // a_string goes out of scope and drop is called
  // memory is then freed

fn make_copy(a_int: i32) {
  // a_int comes into scope
  println!("{}", a_int);
} // a_int goes out of scope and nothing happens because ownership is restored (Copy type)

fn take_and_give_back(a_string: String) -> String {
  a_string // a_string is returned and moved out to the calling function
}
// these are examples of ownership being transferred between functions

// when a variable that includes data on the heap goes out of scope
// the value will be cleaned up by drop
// unless the data has been moved to be owned by another variable

fn return_multiple_values(a_string: String) -> (String, String) {
  let another_string = a_string.clone(); // deep cloned into a new string variable
  (another_string, a_string) // returns a tuple with the new cloned string and the old string
                             // ownership of both the new and old string are returned to the calling function
}

// Because all of this is a pain in the ass
// Rust has a feature called references
// Passing a reference to a object instead of taking ownership is much more effective
fn using_a_reference(s: &String) -> usize {
  s.len() // the function then uses the reference to find the length of the string passed to it
          // uses the reference to do calculations on without having actual ownership of the data
}
// changing "&String" to "&mut String"
// you can only have one mutable reference to a particular piece of data in a particular scope
// let r1 = &mut s;
// let r2 = &mut s; // this fails
//  let r1 = &s; // no problem
//  let r2 = &s; // no problem
//  let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM
// when a reference goes out of scope a new one can be made on the same data
// you can't combine mutable and immutable references
// this prevents data races:
//  two or more pointers access the same data at the same time
//  at least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data
//  there's no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data
// references are immutable by default and you can't modify the data they point to
// references as function arguments is known as borrowing
// references allow you to refer to a value without taking ownership of it
// since strings store String data to the stack a reference to the string data is a pointer to a pointer that points to content on the heap
// The opposite of referencing by using & is dereferencing which uses *

// can't return references to objects created inside the scope
// the new object is dropped at the end of the scope so a reference would be to an invalid object
// references to an object that no longer exists is known as a dangling reference
// if you return the object instead the ownership is moved out and nothing is de-allocated

// Rules of References
//  At any given time, you can either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references
//  References must always be valid

// Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection
//
//// fn first_word(s: &String) -> usize {
// convert string to bytes to parse through bytes and find a space
////let bytes = s.as_bytes();

// loop through iterator created with iter for "bytes"
// iter is a method that returns each element in a collection
// enumerate wraps the results of iter and returns each element as a part of a tuple instead
// first return value from enumerate is the index
// second return value in the tuple from enumerate is a reference to the element
// i is the current index out of the bytes collection
// &item is a reference to the current item
// (i, &item) is an example of destructing a tuple from the return of enumerate
////for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
////if item == b' ' {
// if the item is a space (in bytes) then return the current index
////return i;
////}
////}

// otherwise return the length of the string by using len() method
////s.len()
////}
// removed code that was replaced by better string slice methods
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
  // &str instead of &String allows us to work with string slices and &Strings
  // if we have a String we can pass a slice of the entire String (&String[..])
  // this makes our function more general and accessible without losing any functionality
  // converts reference string to parsable bytes
  let bytes = s.as_bytes();

  // parses through bytes with enumerate and iter
  for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
    // if the reference to the element passed from enumerate is a space
    if item == b' ' {
      // then return a reference from the start of the string to wherever the index is
      return &s[..i];
    }
  }
  &s[..] // returns a reference to a string slice
  // this return reference is tied to underlying data (directly correlates with the string passed into the function)
  // string slice points to a part of the actual string location with a length of how long the slice is
  // with slices if data is cleared it will through a compiler error
}
// string literals are string slices
// it's a slice pointing to that specific point of the binary
// also why string literals are immutable (&str is an immutable reference)

// other slices include slices of arrays
// let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
// &a[1..3] <-- this is a slice as well but not a string slice
// works in the same way as a string but is for more general data types such as collections
